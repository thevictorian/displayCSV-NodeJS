# displayCSV-NodeJS
Creating a NodeJS application for uploading and displaying CSV contents:

Before using: check each module file for its package requirements - use "npm install [package]" in command line as needed.

The code for the modules was adapted from an image upload/display example within 'The Node Beginner Book' (http://leanpub.com/nodebeginner)

Using this application, the user can create a local instance of a Node JS server for webpage-based upload and display of a csv file.
